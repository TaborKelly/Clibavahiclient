# Clibavahiclient

A Swift "system library" for [libavahi-client](https://www.avahi.org/).

This exists mainly to facilitate building [AvahiClient](https://github.com/TaborKelly/AvahiClient), which exists mainly to demonstrate a bug in LLDB.

## Building

### Ubuntu
Building on Ubuntu "just works" as long as you `sudo apt-get install libavahi-client-dev`.
